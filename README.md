Cross-browser support for the [CSS3 Flexible Box Model](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/). Check out [The Playground](http://flexiejs.com/playground/) to see it in action.
# Flexie v1.0.4 [![](http://stillmaintained.com/doctyper/flexie.png)](http://stillmaintained.com/doctyper/flexie)

## Latest update

* Forked & fixed error resulting from a conflict between adblockers and flexie. 

## Browser Support
* IE 6-9
* Opera 10.0+

The Flexible Box Model is [supported natively](http://www.caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox) by these browsers:

* Firefox 3.0+
* Safari 3.2+
* Chrome 5.0+

In addition, Flexie attempts to normailze browser inconsistencies with the flexible box model.

### Currently Supported Properties
* box-orient
* box-align
* box-direction
* box-pack
* box-flex
* box-flex-group
* box-ordinal-group

## Why?
I *really* wanted to use the CSS3 Flexible Box Model.

## How?
It works like [Selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com). In fact, it uses Selectivizr's engine to traverse your style sheets and looks for `display: box` elements. After that, it looks for any of the currently supported properties.

Note: Flexie looks for non-vendor-prefixed properties. For example, it will ignore `-moz-box-pack`, but not `box-pack`. For best results, make sure to use a non-vendor-prefixed property _in addition to_ your prefixed properties. But you were already doing that to future-proof your code, weren't you?

No setup on your end, just stick Flexie in your markup after your [selector engine of choice](http://selectivizr.com/#things).

## Requirements
See the [things you need to know](http://selectivizr.com/#things)

## Caveats
* For older browsers (IE < 8), please remember that some advanced selectors (child, adjacent, pseudo-selectors) will fail. Flexie does not attempt to bridge this gap, so if you must support legacy browsers, class names and ID selectors are your best bets.

* As of FF 4.0 / Chrome 7 / Safari 5, Gecko and Webkit differ slightly in their flexbox implementations. <strike>Of note is their default values. Webkit will default to `box-align: start`, while Gecko defaults to the spec-defined `box-align: stretch`. Make sure your flexbox CSS works on both these browsers before adding Flexie.</strike>
	* As of version 0.7, Flexie normalizes the `box-align` property across Webkit browsers.
	* As of version 0.8, Flexie normalizes the `box-pack` property in Gecko.

* Be careful of pseudo-selectors (i.e., `:nth-child`, `:first-child`). While native flexbox does not modify the DOM, Flexie must. Thus, your CSS properties might not apply as intended. For example, if you use a combination of `box-direction: reverse` and a `:first-child` selector, that selector will target the wrong element. And if you followed all of that, congratulations.

* There may be cases where the floats used to mimic the flexbox layout drop in Internet Explorer browsers. If possible, you can try the [overflow fix](http://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/) to snap these into place _(Flexie assumes it cannot use this as a workaround due to the impact this may have in your layouts)_.

* As of YUI 2.8.2r1, YUI's selector engine does not recognize dashed attributes (i.e. [data-name="foo"]). Flexie uses several [data- attributes](http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/) as element flags. A bug report [has been filed](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui2/ticket/2529254) about this issue, but in the meantime YUI remains incompatible with Flexie.

## Asynchronous API
You can run Flexie asynchronously in case you cannot purely on style sheets. All parameters are optional, unless otherwise stated:

### Creating a new Flexie Object
	var box = new Flexie.box({
		target : document.getElementById("foo"),
		orient : "horizontal",
		align : "stretch",
		direction : "normal",
		pack : "start",
		flexMatrix : [1, 1, 1, 1],
		ordinalMatrix : [0, 0, 0, 0]
	});

*	**target**
	(required) The flexbox parent element. This must be a DOM node.
*	**orient**
	(optional) Possible values: `horizontal`, `vertical`
*	**align**
	(optional) Possible values: `stretch`, `start`, `end`, `center`
*	**direction**
	(optional) Possible values: `normal`, `reverse`
*	**pack**
	(optional) Possible values: `start`, `end`, `center`, `justify`
*	**flexMatrix**
	(optional) An array of values to apply to the parent's children. e.g.:
		flexMatrix : [1, 0, 0] // Three child nodes contained, the parent's first child has a box-flex value of 1
		flexMatrix : [1, 0, 1] // Three child nodes contained, the parent's first and last child have a box-flex value of 1
		flexMatrix : [1, 1, 1] // Three child nodes contained, all children have a box-flex value of 1
*	**ordinalMatrix**
	(optional) An array of values to apply to the parent's children. See `flexMatrix` for an example.

### Flexie.updateInstance(target, params)
Used to redraw currently active Flexie objects (i.e., after dynamically updating a flexbox element). All parameters optional.

_Note: Calling this method without parameters will update all instances._

*	**target**
	(optional) The flexbox element to update.
*	**params**
	(optional) An object of flexbox properties to update. See Creating a new Flexie Object for accepted parameters.

### Flexie.getInstance(target)
Returns the target instance

*	**target**
	(optional) The flexbox instance to retrieve.
	
### Flexie.destroyInstance(target)
Destroys the target instance.

_Note: Calling this method without parameters will destroy all instances._

*	**target**
	(optional) The flexbox instance to retrieve.
	
### Flexie.flexboxSupported
An exposed object detailing the level of flexbox support. Returns false for no support.
